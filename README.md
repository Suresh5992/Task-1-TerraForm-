overview of Task :

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and manage your infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. Hereâ€™s an overview of what you can do with Terraform

Key Features of Terraform:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Terraform uses a declarative language (HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define the desired state of your infrastructure.
You can write code to create, manage, and destroy infrastructure components like servers, databases, networks, etc.
Provider Support:

Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more.
It can also manage on-premises environments and other infrastructure services.
Execution Plan:

Terraform generates an execution plan (terraform plan) before applying any changes. This plan outlines what actions will be taken to reach the desired state.
The plan allows you to review the changes before making them.
State Management:

Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure.
The state file is crucial for planning and applying changes, as it helps Terraform determine the difference between the desired state and the current state.
Modularity:

Terraform supports the use of modules, which are reusable configurations that can be shared across projects.
This promotes code reuse and helps maintain consistent configurations across environments.
Dependency Management:

Terraform automatically handles dependencies between resources, ensuring that resources are created, updated, or destroyed in the correct order.
Collaboration:

Terraform supports collaboration through remote state management, locking, and version control integration.
This is useful in team environments where multiple people are working on the same infrastructure.
Automation:

Terraform can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated provisioning and management of infrastructure.
